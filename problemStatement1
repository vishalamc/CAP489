/*Q1:A doctor is giving advice to patient about how to 
maintain our body which type of food we should take.
For that doctor asks for the number of calories and fat grams 
in a food. Then it display the percentage of calories that come
from fat. If the calories from fat are less then 30% of the
total calories of the food, it should also display a message
indicating that the food is low in fat.
Note: consider one gram of fat has 9 calories.*/
let cal:number=1000;
let fat:number=90;
let fatCal:number=fat*9;
let per:number;
if(fatCal>cal)
{
    console.log("number of calories in the food=",cal+"Calories");
    console.log("number of fat grams in the food=",fat+"grams");
    console.log("Calories from fat cannot be greater");
}
else{
        per=(fatCal/cal)*100;
        console.log("number of calories in the food=",cal+"Calories");
        console.log("number of fat grams in the food=",fat+"grams");
        console.log("The percentage of calories from fat is: ",per+"%");
    if(per<30)
    {
    console.log("This food is low in fat");
    }
    else
    {
    console.log("This food is high in fat"); 
    }
}
